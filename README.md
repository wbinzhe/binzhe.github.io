Hi, I’m binzhe wang.
// I’m interested in the Eoncomy of Cities.
 - transportation: the movement of goods and people. In particular, does distance STILL matter in a digital world?
 - consumer cities: people, amenities, and quality of life. In particular, what do we like and what do we hate about cities?
