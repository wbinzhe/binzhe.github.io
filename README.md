Hi, I’m Binzhe.
I’m interested in the Eoncomy of Cities.
 - consumer cities: people, amenities and quality of life
 - transportation: the movement of goods and people

People I admire.
 - Jane Jacobs. Acute perception of the world does not rely on numbers. 
 - Dave Donaldson. International Economics talk show! 
 - Shanjun Li. Warms students as his kids. 
 - Ruixue Jia. I wish to know more about her.
