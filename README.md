Hi, I’m binzhe wang.
I’m interested in the Economy of Cities.
 - urban form and the built environment: why have cities evolved into their present physical form?
 - transportation and the new economic geography: does distance STILL matter within cities in a digital era?
 - people, amenities, and quality of life: what do we like and hate about cities?
